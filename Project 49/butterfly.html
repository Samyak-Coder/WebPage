        <p>Using an easy-to-follow tutorial, you can learn how to make a little origami butterfly. It's a traditional origami model that is a good introduction to the art of paper folding popularized by the Japanese. The word origami means "folding paper" (ori means "folding," and kami is "paper" in Japanese).</p>
        <p>The origami butterfly has a simple but elegant look. Once you learn how to make one, you won't want to stop. An entire group of paper butterflies makes a wonderful wall decoration. You can also use them to embellish handmade cards, scrapbooks, and even as the finishing touch on gift wrapping.</p>
