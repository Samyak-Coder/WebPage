        <p>In many cultures, a lotus flower represents beauty, elegance, purity, spiritual enlightenment and wisdom. Just like the rose, its meaning depends on its color. White is a symbol of purity; blue symbolizes knowledge and wisdom, and red is a symbol of love. The pink lotus is considered the supreme lotus as it is associated with holy deities.</p>
        <p>This flower is one of the easiest designs to fold (as long as you have the right paper - see below) so this is an ideal project for beginners, children or anyone looking for a satisfying hobby!</p>
